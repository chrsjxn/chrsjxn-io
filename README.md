# Hey! ðŸ‘‹

This is just a quick site I threw together as a dumping ground for writing blog posts and experimenting with components and new tech, like Svelte.

I take pride in my work, but I make no guarantees about the quality or performance of this code.

## Interested in learning Svelte for yourself?

The [official tutorials](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics) are great, and the REPL makes it easy to tinker without needing a local development setup.

`npm run dev` will get this site up and running locally.
