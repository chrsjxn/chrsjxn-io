  <h1>Chris Jackson <span class="pronouns">(he/him)</span></h1>
  <p>
    I am a senior web engineer (react, typescript), working on building up my
    full stack skills (graphql, node).
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a prolific code reviewer. I think a good code review practice helps the
    whole team learn and stay connected. I think code review is one of the best
    chances for engineers to get feedback about their work, and how to improve.
  </p>
  <p>I believe diverse voices improve products, teams, and the world.</p>
